    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>Local Storage vs Session Storage</h2>
        <p>The difference is that while data in LocalStorage doesn't expire. On the other hand Session Storage data is cleared when the page session ends.</p>

        <h2>Global scope vs Block scope</h2>
        <p>ES6 introduced two inportant new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
            These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. 
            Variable declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.</p>
        <p>A variable declared outside a function, becomes Global.
            All script and functions on a web page can access it.
            Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Gobal Scope.</p>
        
        <h2>How does work JavaScript Event loop?</h2>
        <p>The Event loop has one simple job. To monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.</p>
